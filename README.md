This project was inspired by the John Olivers Cryptocurrency segment to show just how easy it is to create a new coin. 

* Name = johnolivercoin (JOC)
* Initial Reward = 1,000 coins (why not)
* Block Interval = 10 minutes (what's the rush)
* Max Supply = 1,000,000,000 (just because)

This is created from a clone of Litecoin 0.8.
